My thought process for the levels

Number of Levels:  4
1. Intro level, nothing too serious, just a couple of simple enemies and the player has to get to the end of the level 

2. Introduce new mechanic??? (time slow) map should use timeslow creatively

4. "sandbox" level, player should be able to use mechanics to their liking
